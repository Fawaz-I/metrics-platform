# metrics-platform
Cloud-native Java metrics and alerting platform with REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and performance testing (Spring Boot + Quarkus)

## Role Alignment
This project is explicitly designed to reflect the responsibilities of the **Software Engineer** role (Job ID: R-053448) at **Red Hat**, demonstrating hands-on expertise with the required technology stack.

*   **REST APIs with Java/Spring**: Implemented scalable, high-performance RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot (and planned Quarkus integration).
*   **Postgres + NoSQL**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for structured metric data, with planned integration for NoSQL (MongoDB) for unstructured logs/events.
*   **Docker + Kubernetes**: Fully containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes manifests (OpenShift-ready design patterns).
*   **Performance Testing**: Future roadmap includes JMeter/Gatling integration for load testing and performance validation.
*   **CI/CD & IaC**: Planned integration with Jenkins pipelines and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code provisioning.
